# Logic Behind Filtering Non-Academic Authors

The program identifies non-academic authors based on their affiliations. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1 Extract Author Information:
The program retrieves the list of authors from the PubMed API response.

2 Check for Non-Academic Institutions:
If an author's affiliation contains words like university, school, college, or lab, they are considered academic.
If an author does not have these keywords in their affiliation, they are considered non-academic.

3 Return Non-Academic Authors & Company Names:
The program extracts the names of non-academic authors and their affiliated companies.
